  To complete the worksheet you will need income and expense information for **both parents**. You may estimate these numbers if you do not have exact figures, but the results you will get will not be compeltly accurate.

question: |
  What parenting arangment is closest to yours?
fields:
  - "Total number of children?": children_number    
    datatype: number    
    help: Input what you think the total number of children that are eligible for support payments under this order.
  - Choose: parenting_arangment
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Box 1 Parenting and financial responsibilties are **shared** mostly equally.
      - Box 2 The children live with one parent about **two-thirds** of the time.
      - Box 3 The children are **split** between the parents, and each parent has primary custody of atleast one child.
right: |
  ## Need Help?
    
  Pick the choice from the options that you think is most similar to yours. 
  
  **Box 1 ** should be selected if the children live with you and the other parent about the same amount of time, and you and the other parent have mostly equal financial responsibility for the children.
  
  **Box 2** should be selected if the children live with one parent at least two-thirds of the time. This is the case when children live with one parent Monday-Friday, or when the children stay with one parent for one week, but the other for two. 
  
  **Box 3** should be selected if more than one child is covered by the order and they do not all live with the same parent. For example one child lives mostly with one parent and the other children live with the other parent. If each parent has atleast one child who lives with them the majority of the time, or each parent's house is the home for one or more children, this is the correct box to select.

    note: |
      The judge will look at the following reasons for including these children in the order:
     
      * Your child’s living situation, like why your child lives with you, and when and how much time they live with you;
      * Why your child is mainly dependent on you;
      * Your child’s academic situation, like their progress in school, or if they are part-time of full-time;
      * All kinds of resources the parents may have, like a bedroom for the child or the ability to help with school work; and
      * Each parent’s contribution to post-secondary education costs for the child or other children in the family.
